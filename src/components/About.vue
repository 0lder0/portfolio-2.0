            <p>
                I'm a 19-year-old student from Tartu, studying at Tartu's Vocational College. I've been learning coding for 3 years now. I really enjoy working on the frontend of websites, but I also want to improve my skills in backend development. It feels amazing to see something I've created and think about how to make it even better.
